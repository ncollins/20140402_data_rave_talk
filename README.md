An Overview of Woosh and Seaborn
================================

My lightning talk at [Data Rave](http://www.meetup.com/Data-Rave/events/170730922/)
on 2014-04-02. It's based on the data from the [Say What](https://github.com/ncollins/say_what)
project.

I gave a very rushed intro to the [Woosh](https://bitbucket.org/mchaput/whoosh/wiki/Home) and
[Seaborn](http://www.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/index.html) libraries for Python.
